Once upon a time, in a forest there lived a Monkey who resided on a jamoon tree, Which was on a bank of a river. In the same forest,
There lived a crocodile and his wife. One day, the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted Monkey
offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, As he loved them. As this passed by, The crocodile and the
Monkey became good friends.
